### Patch Changes

- [`6e6cad0`](https://github.com/galosandoval/shopfloor/commit/6e6cad0e1ec9567bff97c3220a87abda5cd1b1f2) Thanks [@galosandoval](https://github.com/galosandoval)! - Establish a Changesets release pipeline. `ci.yml` is replaced by `release.yml`,
  whose `verify` job runs lint/typecheck/test/build (plus `changeset status` on
  PRs) and whose `release` job publishes to npm via an OIDC trusted publisher
  with provenance. No package behavior changes; README gains a versioning
  section and its consumer-repo references are corrected to `recipe-chat-v1`.
